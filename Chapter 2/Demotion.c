#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
// *1 Demotion
// *2 Demotion in equation

// *1 Demotion
          int a = 7.5; // As we know INT cannot be in decimal So here 7.5 will become 7 this process is called demotion.
Demotion :  7.5 = 7



// *2 Demotion in equation occurs after the result
    int k = 3.0/9;
        Answer : 0.3333; //But as (k) cannot store 0.3333, Demotion will delet part after decimal (.) and only 0 remains.
        Real Answer = 0

}
