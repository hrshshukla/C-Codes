2. If S[3] is a 1-D array of integers then *(S+3) refers to the third element:
    (i) True.
    (ii) False.
    (iii) Depends.

    Visual Representation of Array S:
    
     Element No.|   Element
    -------------------------
        1       |   S[0] 
        2       |   S[1] 
        3       |   S[2] 
        4       |   S[3]    <---- As we can see that "S" from S[0] the S[3] is 4th element */
